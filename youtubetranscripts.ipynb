            " now let's talk about something very important which is Pisa I mean money so did you have the fear as well like did you have doubt like lot of people have this doubt like what if things don't work out like and I don't know if you took the loan we're going to get to that part uh let's talk about profile because everyone likes to know like so what was your G score tofel score ILS if if that's what you did and your bachelor's as well all right welcome back Shai thank you so much for doing this uh I'm excited today we are going to explore the life of Sai at Yukon how did it happened from the Inception that you decided you want to do Masters and like the finishing the Masters and obviously now you're the lead data analyst so uh for people who might have not watched our first part of the video let's do a quick intro like where are you from what do you do and fun stuff yep uh I'm from gur Andra Pradesh and then I have done my bachelor in electrical and then right after my bachelor I moved to United States to pursue my masters at Yukon and then my major was data science and then I started working as lead dat Analyst at BlueCross Blue Shield of South Carolina uh and then it's my fourth month right now nice and for people for the context on in our last video we did we talk about how he moved his background from electrical to becoming a data analyst and so link is in the description you should go check it out plus s is also making content on LinkedIn and talking about those stuff as well so you should check that out as well but let's s let's talk about why did you decide like you were doing your Bachelor at some point you like okay I want to do Master why did you decide like what was your thought process that you want to do Masters yeah like most of uh most of the people like I wanted to study abroad and then work abroad and then I have to I wanted to have an experience and then during my second year of my bachelor I decided that I would be doing my higher I want to do some higher studies so I was confused between mtech or uh Ms like but my thought was like first I'll do Masters or mtech in electrical then later on I started researching about opportunities in after mtech and opportunities after Masters then I found that like Masters was more uh how do I say it like it has more opportunities to get like it has more opportunities when compared to mtech so I decided to do Masters in electrical at first and then like later on during my third year and fourth year I had some electives related to data analysis which SQL and then I had a machine learning course too that's how I got introduced to this data world and then I got in intrigued by a lot of those and then I started researching on them then I was very good at math like from my Eng age so I thought I'll give it a try so I started researching more on it like took some courses apart from my bachelor courses and then I thought I'll do it and then in my I took I started researching about everything and then I started my masters m nice so obviously you made a decision that I want to do Masters based on that why did you decide to do it in United States though why not Canada UK Australia like why USA yeah my first instinct was to go to United Kingdom because it was like eight hour flight from India so I thought I'll not miss my family and friends but then after doing lots of research and I thought like opportunities like there are only five states in United UK and then the visa rules uh are not similar to United States so and then Australia was not at all in my list and then coming to Canada the temperatures were very harsh coming from Andra it's very it's a very OD year and then I thought I couldn't handle the negative temperatures in Canada so like all together and then it's a huge onetime investment so I thought USA is a uh good point to start my like higher studies nice okay and so obviously you knew the tech world is booming in United States and and that's where the opportunities are uh you decided that you want to do it us is my country that's where I want to go now comes the part where sometimes like lot of times where you have to convince your parents like hey I want to leave this country I'm going to be not with you guys and you know so like how did you had to convince your parents or your parents is like J simja and no so this is something funny my parents knew that I would go to you I would leave India when I was born because of the stars and something but then uh they weren uh happy and until like they didn't see me until I got into my bachelor and then once I got into my bachelor I started getting uh this started doing some research and I thought I'll go to Masters and then like day by day I was telling them that I want to do Masters and then like slowly I was getting that my thought into their minds and then eventually that they understood that he needs he wants to do Masters and then like they were wanted to send me but then deep inside like every parent like every mom and dad they would miss us so my mom was very sad because I mean like you will be coming only once in a year and I mean obviously that those were some of your parents fear but like did you have the fear as well like did you have doubt like a lot of people have this doubt like what if things don't work out like and I don't know if you took the loan we going to get to that part like but like I'm investing so much money what if this doesn't work out and like did you have those especially you like switching from electrical to data science field right so did you have those fears or you were very confident like the I know what I'm doing no no no like I had some basic fears like uh so coming to the money part like I took a loan so I had the doubt like would I get a job once I graduate so that was the one of my biggest fears and then would I survive in United States and then all these years until my 12th I was at home and then during my pte uh I wasn't going out much so I was all alone or mostly I was like a introvert thing so I thought like would I survive in a like all different country within like all new people coming from different parts of the world with different cultures and then I was very bad at cooking like I and then I don't eat much vegetables or fruits so all these concerns like made me think like is it worth it or not and then once I thought about my career like I need to take risk at some point let it be at the younger age like than to risk take risk at in late 30 or early 30s I thought I'll risk it at early 20s I was 20 when I had this plan so I was like let me risk now so I took the chance and then I told my parents like this is what my plan is this is what I'll be switching my career and this is what my plan is after going to United States once I graduate and this is when I'll come back from United States to India and do you think that helped uh ease a little bit to your parents and to yourself like I have a plan and so would you also recommend students that they should have like a clear picture before they decide like okay I'm just going to go yeah it's good to have a clear picture but then I'm sure it will change once they come to United States and meet new people and then once they see the real American job market and then the opportunities or the the education style will be very different we should be flexible and adaptable to anything that comes up yeah yeah what uh let's talk about profile because everyone likes to know like so what was your gr score toel score ILS if if that's what you did and your bachelors's as well yeah my bachelor's uh my zpa was 9.1 and then coming to my is I had a 7.5 and then my gr was 329 uh math was 169 and then verbal was 160 with an hour score of 4.5 and then this is my profile uh before I came to United States right and uh you obviously didn't have any work experience so that wasn't part of your profile so um so obviously like the scores were really great and I would be actually I don't know I mean this probably is not planned but I would be interested to see your statement of purpose like how did you convince universities but before yeah before we get there uh uh what all universities did you apply to and how did you think about applying to those universities because there's like thousands of universities so why did you apply to only those so let's talk about those yeah first thing I had in my mind was I wanted to be near New York City or uh California because those were the uh hubs for startups or like lot of tech companies which where there were like headquarters or like top companies or any company most of them were into West or into East so and then like they send Texas in the middle like I sorted down only these three parts like west east or Central and then I found some good universities uh which accepts applications for uh freshers because some of the admiss universities they will not they will not accept uh people without experience so I had to drill out the universities who accepts freshes and then in the field of data science and business analytics so I sorted on some universities like Yukon was one of them which like this University was accepting pressures also and then I applied to UDD and then I applied to San Francisco State University and then Arizona State University and then I applied to North Eastern University and then Penn State University so I had applied to University of South Florida also because they had nice curriculum for business analytics I applied around seven universities okay and and so again breaking down your list uh obviously you had like East Coast you also had California but then you had like Arizona like sounds like ASU you probably went with the brand branding of it USF obviously their coursework is very well known in terms of Florida and business analytics course uh I think and it's also in the bigger city like Tempa so that's good Pennsylvania State University obviously the brand itself is is good so so I see the pattern that you saw did did you apply to the same uh major or similar major like because I think not all of them you went for data science some of them sounds like business analytics and some of them were different yeah for Pennsyvania and the northeastern applied for computer science because I see that they have a data science uh major that they can take later on so concentration something like that so for Pennsyvania and nor Eastern it was computer science and then for USF and Yukon it was business analytics and then for UD and others it was uh data science uh with like business analytics with data sence concentration so mostly it was databased but then for PSU and Northeastern uh with computer science H okay did any of them had prerequisite because you're coming from Electronics background yeah that's one of the problems I faced I got admits from all of them except USF because they wanted two years of work experience I knew I would get rejected but then I just wanted to give a try because I had good scores but then I got rejected so I was fine with it coming to Northeastern and PSU uh they gave me ad bits but what happened to penvan was they gave me ad bit for next semester so I had to drop it down coming to Northeast they gave me admit for computer science but then they gave me some prerequisites so it would I had to do around 55 credits or 54 credits and then it's a threeyear program so I was like not going to happen so I ruled out not the also and then I was left with Ukon UT and then I got from ASU and then from one of the universities applied in California so I was left with four admits four perfect admits nice okay for perfect admit which does not have a prerequisite and I think all of them were around analytics course data science or business analytics all of them and since you were clear that you wanted to get into data science field you know that you saw the course work etc now comes the part where you had to make a decision of out of four you have to choose one what on what basis you decided Yukon because like you you obviously chose Yukon so what was it that you liked most about that so coming from electrical background I wanted to learn more in data science because it's a transition so I didn't want to limit myself to learning less so you can had 37 gr scores and then the rest of the colleges I had were like only 30 gr sces and then there's more learning here that's one of the reasons and then another reason was the one admit I had was UTD which is in Texas I didn't want to go to Texas because like there are lot of Indians I wanted diversity and then I wanted to be around people who are from America or like different parts of the world so that I can learn something new I could see people from different cultures so I rolled out UTD in from that list so I was left with uh Yukon and then San Francisco State University and then San Francisco State University the fees was very less but then the course was was not as good as Yukon business analytics and then Yukon is like 20 mil from New York City and then like 2 hours from Boston and then like all the tech hubs and then everything you youon had good reputation around the Northeast part like in Conneticut or like massach or New York and New Jersey and then it had good name and then the propers I had reached out to them before joining so they were uh they replied to me and then we had some initial calls so that I could understand what they're expecting I connect with some of seniors from both the University and then I I thought Yukon is a good University for my profile like because uh when I see the percentage of people without experience in Yukon it's good too because and then I thought uh I'll get some peers within my within my age and then there lot of experience people to because this comes with uh project management also so there are two things business analytics and project management so I learn uh experience like there will be a lot of people who are experienced and it's a business program it's a it's in business school so I I chose Yukon over the other three colleges yeah yeah and one of the things I want to talk about is um uh so you explained the process of uh shortlisting it and then choosing out of the shortlisted universities choosing one of them but I think there's a lot of research went behind that right like so you what what did your day look like when you were researching this like how did you research it like was it through just online videos or you actually reached out to people and obviously some portion of it was online just reading the coursework and understanding that but some might be reaching out to seniors and alumin and um how did you fig like did the research part yeah coming to aluminate part like I wasn't much connected with my uh am seniors so I didn't know how to reach out to them and then I was introvert as I mentioned so I didn't take the alumni I didn't get much help from alumni part so and then my dad's friends Sons they were settled in United States so I had some talks with them and then obviously the Google and YouTube were my gurus back then like I would go on YouTube say and then that's how I found every you and then like not me I think most of most of us know you from YouTube so I watch lot of videos from lot of lots of channels and then I and I made a plan like where to start where to end what to do do and then noted down everything like what exams should I take and then what certificates do I need and then I started applying for those certificates uh to my university and then they us to Career M and then like all these Bank certificates financials and everything like academics to financials and then flight tickets where to find WhatsApp groups where to find people who wants to help and then I made like list of resources that they could use for that I could use to sort down like sort down the all the lists and uh everything so YouTube and then my dad's friends yeah and you mentioned reaching out to Professor so was that after you have made a decision of Yukon or was that before like that was part of the decision making as well no I mean like that was part of the decision making but then uh I reached out to professors after getting admit I didn't want to reach out before getting admit so I reached out to some of the professors after getting admits in all the universities and then I had some 15 minutes calls with different professors from different departments from different universities so I thought it easy how did you like what did you tell them that hey I want to I got an admit and I want to understand can you get on a call with me is that what like what did you say similar to it with like I have expanded like saying that I have this course in my bachelor and then I have done this electives like SQL and machine learning that I have mentioned and then I have done some uh Emi courses out of my interest because I wanted to uh Explore More and then get to know in this field and then I have applied to this University this University and then I got the admit so I thought I could I I mean I'll know what you need to prepare before coming to United States or before starting the course and then your guidance would help me a lot so like some of them reply like two professors replied from Yukon and then like from other universities like one or two or three professors replied and then I scheduled a call with them we are like 10 to 15 minutes call I didn't want to take more of their time because like their time is valuable so so I got some class on how the course their course work is going to be in particular and then like how the United States life is how I should be prepared like what else I need to do before coming to United States and then starting the course nice yeah I like it I love the approach you took and obviously this is what I wanted people to get out of this is that you know you have to do this research and don't just rely on like consultant did you go to consultant uh no no everything by yeah yeah so uh again uh great job so now let's talk about the details like the application process when and timeline wise when did you start uh and like what what all things did you need it for the application process assuming it's the same but like let's just walk through all the things uh I'm assuming it's going to need St um sop uh letter of recommendation transcripts and all of those things which which are like very common was there anything else I know some universities do videos in video interviews so I graduated uh from my bachelor in August 21 so if I go in August 21 and then I will be graduating in like say let's say two years I'll be graduating in May 23 but then because I'm transitioning from my electrical to data science I didn't want to go in a Harry man manner so I thought I'll take three months off and then go in spring so I thought I'll research on what needs to be done instead going to United States and struggling there so as I mentioned like did some unic courses and then even because of the covid I wasn't ready with the all the Sops also and then like uh Sops and War and the exams I was ready with all this course but then then I thought I was doing some courses and then I was in middle of that so I didn't want to risk it so I took like three months bre like usually fall start in September and then spring starts in Jan it's like 3 months difference so I took my time to like prepare myself because of carer transition and then uh because of the flights and everything it got delayed too so that's so my time then is like yeah so you went in January uh and when did you apply for that yeah I started applying from June 21 yeah it like five to six months before and then for the exam preparations like for math I didn't have to I didn't have to prepare much because like I have written cat and other like other exams and then snap so like I was very pretty good at math and then I had to just prepare for verbal for C and then ISS so is was pretty easy like if you have basic knowledge of like what to do and then like what how to read and write so the those exams were like very like I didn't have much difficulty in preparing for those so it took me around one month to prepare for the exams and then I was done with the exams by end of the July and then while preparing for my exams I asked my professor said uh am to give me some letter of recommendations so I got the L by the time I completed uh my exams and then once I got my LS and then done with my exams I started working on my sop it took me around 15 days or 20 days to get my sop done so by uh August first week or second week like I had everything I wanted and then I got like transcripts from my University also so within few 10 days I applied to all the seven universities because I had sorted on already during myep had did some research on which coures to do I mean which universities to apply for which coures to apply and then like all the amounts noted down and then like I was ready with the money too I told my dad that I need this much amount of money so I was ready with everything by August first week and then I applied to everything by third week Max okay so you applied roughly around August time frame yeah and then you started getting admits um roughly September is October is yeah some of them I got like Yukon has this uh like you will get accepted or rejected within two weeks mostly for most of us most of us who studed at Yukon we got accepted or rejected within like one week or two weeks Max for the other universities UTD took around one month and then rest of them took like 15 days some of them and then two months and three months so it dependent it was depend on the University rather than and the course and the competition also because of the covid guidelines and covid rules some of them they were like still deciding and then about the flights should we go or not and then from the United States perspective should we take or not so it was all confusing at that times yeah right and uh obviously and so you went through it and you got a lot of admits I would be curious to see your sop I don't know if you have it handy already uh but if you do I have it yeah nice um yeah for audience like this this was not planned I was like I'm just thinking I oh it'll be cool if we can show it all right we get to see the real deal just telling people you should not copy paste this make your own thing but uh go ahead uh like what was your thought process designing this sop yeah first PL was I would talk about like uh what's like what I want to do and then like why I want to pursue uh Masters in Business analytics at Yukon and then my second par and then I started talking about my course work back in am like what I had done and then what was am like it was cranked forth by NF and then I what all I learned related to Electrical uh my stream which was electrical and I mentioned I learn Power Electronics and everything and then I also introduced got introduced to Technologies like machine learning and then that's I got some interest into uh data science and then I mentioned because matth is very important in data science so I I included saying that I had orade in all these courses like which are important to which are important in data science like Al zebra calcul statistics and probability so that would add lot of weightage to my profile because data math is very important data science so then I mentioned that I have fulfilled the required Math course work of [Music] Masters and then I me I moved on to Concepts that I had learned in machine learning and then my cgba and then I was awarded distinction for the Same by the university because like uh they awarded a distinction for top five people in the university for every Department nice and then I had published a paper during my andrad uh which was based on electric vehicles and then it got published to it we got to present to the people at I and then and I also published a paper related to uh deep learning when I was doing my preparation for getting into University so I thought I wanted to stand out so I did a project and then I wrote a paper and then I submitted to this IJ ETS so they liked it and then they accepted that publication too so I had two Publications at that time one was related to electrical one was related to deep learning and then started to explain about my projects that I have done uh back in the field of electric and electronics then I mve to projects that I've have done in the machine learning so like movie Revenue prediction system and then like which is very like Ed is very important in every data science project like every machine learning project mention that model and then what was what tools or models did they use did they use and then mentioned that I used Python and SQL machine learning and everything and then coming to business analytics so these are the basic skills that every role requires every Ro require like SQL parb and tblo yeah this was another project that I did using deep learning technique I mentioned it here which was like um text trans so all these all these projects did you do while doing doing a bachelor or okay not while doing bachelor once I in the final semester of Bachelors because since I was transitioning getting like say if I had a pure electrical background and then if I was applying for business analytics role in some of the universities they wouldn't accept me because like my profile would be focused on Purely electrical like there's nothing for them to uh accept me and then there's nothing that they can show that I'm interested or passionate in that so I did this project right and I was going to point that out as well like you have completely uh transformed your profile to someone who is into ba or da or data science right like you are embracing the fact that yes I come from electronics and these are the projects I did for that but I also did all this thing which is related to data science and business analytics and that's why I'm a good fit for this program exactly I mean I didn't want to lose my electrical part of it because I had done it for four years and then I had done some applications and amazing projects and then got a distinction and then I didn't want to show that I I was in good fit for business analytics so I thought I need to put something and then I took a six weeks training on intern shella it didn't cost much people can try that out it would cost you around 4,000 rupees and then they'll give six weeks training on basic skills required for data [Music] science and these were my exter activities because like in United States these are very important yeah and then like back in India it might not like all un some of only very few universities offers these extra particular activities but then like feel free to participate so to make your profile stand out so like they'll be they have the separate I mean like everything has weightage not only technical skills but they need extra activities or if you have some medals in some sport so that will add a lot of value yeah yeah and uh yeah yeah at the end I said uh why master's degree is important to me yeah yeah so it's roughly two pages looks like and then roughly 1,200 words what yeah yeah nice um yeah that's that's good I'm glad you shared and it from the structure uh point of view you start with a rough intro like who you are and like a big Vision uh right like throughout like how did you build the interest of data science then you deep dive into what you've done so far uh electronics background you showing that and then how you have SW changed your profile to data science and how it aligns to to the cours work and then you kind of uh wrap it up by saying like here's why Masters is important and like how I uh like how this is important and how this Yukon will be good Fit Plus help me with my future career so great yeah thank you for sharing this now let's talk about something very important which is Pisa I mean money so uh how much did it cost and uh I know we talked about a lot in terms of your short listing that um you've primarily focused on the area like you focused on California New York Texas uh and then based on that you chose the universities then you saw the weatherwise Arizona is not good fit and blah blah blah and some of them gave you prerequisite so that was cost at all a factor for you to decide or you like I don't care I'm like I'm a millionaire I I can afford whatever hey I'm not a milar but then like yeah cost was a factor but then when I told about Masters to my parents they were like what's the budget like the you're thinking then I mentioned for the fees alone I was expecting I would think it would cost around like 40 to 45 lakhs maximum then they were like uh how do you think do you want to pay then I was like I have no idea and then they mentioned okay it's fine we'll put our house for it you don't have to worry but then make sure that you get into good college and then like don't uh like do your best when you go there so I had my family support like they supported me a lot and then like yeah yeah so it sounds like like again if you think about priorities right like so you first short list them then out of short list you go for an admit then you have an admit now you have to choose choose something and so I'm guessing from the choosing perspective for me cost was like number one like it has to be chip like if it is like 50 LS I I just can't afford it for me that's that was the case right but I think sounds like for you that wasn't like the first thing because you weren too worried about it uh you were worried about it but not like like if if it is expensive I'm okay because I want to have the good experience I wasn't that particular about cost but then I just put a threshold of not Crossing 50 lakhs for my University so then I'm like I mean once I get a job I'm sure that I I can repay it in one to two years so then I was like why I have to like settle down for like if it's a good University I'm okay with spending more money and then if it's not up to the Mark I'm like I can't even spend one lak on it so got it that was the thought process right okay so how much does Yukon cost like what was the I20 amount I20 amount was around $50,000 uh I think yeah $50,000 was the I20 amount for that including expenses for 9 months for for nine months okay so that's this is what one year so you the course was obviously two years but and then how much did you end up like spending in including you let's let's talk about cost of living as well and then we'll total it up uh what was your cost of living expenses uh I spent around $1,200 to $1,300 per month including rent and my expenses and groceries and stuff my rent was around $630 per month and then I used to share room with their roommate and then we were seven people living in a four-bedroom apartment so it was quite expensive so yeah Conneticut welcome to Connecticut wow I didn't I didn't know it was that expensive I mean usually I've seen like 600 to 800 600 to ,000 as an expenses but 1,200 to 1400 is is pretty pricey uh and especially you're still sharing the room yeah I don't plat was 4,000 per month wow um that's the cheapest in the city I don't know if you have watched my my videos but like my rent was $225 and I had my personal bedroom uh with my bathroom so so obviously the times have changed for people who are coming to Chico like that's not how much it is but it's also not $630 it's $400 so you still get your private bedroom but regardless okay so that was your cost so roughly $1,200 so you spent about 16 months on your master's program so three semesters was it three semesters yeah yeah and then you finished that so how much did you end up spending total because in the first semester if I remember you don't have you didn't have on campus job we we'll talk about that too but uh so how much did you what was your total expenses it came around to 60 to $70,000 at the end like my fees was around $45,000 and then I had spent around 20,000 or5 to $20,000 on my expenses for in the 15 months so it ended up uh by like at $65,000 including the flight tickets and then everything and then my shopping which was your budget anyway so so it it kind of stayed under that threshold uh and and obviously you took a loan which sounds like it was it sounds like you had a collateral as your property so nice okay and uh you now you've just graduated it's been four months you obviously have a nice very nice job data and dat lead data analyst do you feel confident because at the time you were doubtful and you didn't know whether I'll be pay off now do you feel confident that you will be able to pay off yeah I'm pretty confident like like who listening to this video don't be like don't have any like negative thinking about the money so I'm sure that I'll be paying off this loan by next December I mean unless you are not unless you spend it in limit like with your expenses or something can yeah exactly so everyone can pay their pay off their debt in like two years Max like you don't have to like say starting salary of each employee would be $70,000 if you spend 50,000 50% of your salary for your like trips and everything you're left with $35,000 so like that's like $7,000 in two years which is and and just just to give a little bit more perspective you will not get $70,000 because you would have to pay tax but because you are on OPD you will pay like maybe 15 to 18% tax depending on the which state you are in because some State you don't have to pay state tax at all so you save money there as well but so yeah like uh but yeah overall theme I've heard from lot of students I've met who took like people who went to IV league universities who paid $100,000 even ASU has $100,000 fees they are still able to pay off so I'm sure you will be able to pay off so and this is the reason I try to ask so that parents and students feel confident making that decision um so so okay good now let's talk about uh visa interview I mean how was that was it like you entered and Visa officer was like oh Yukon please congratulations your Visa is approved like what was your experience and what question that was my Embassy experience and then coming to my Visa experience I had like interview for like one minute like I had like only three questions which university and then what were your finances and then what poess did you like would you want to take in your first semester that's it and then it was less than a minute nice so so were you prepared for what courses you want to take in the first semester yeah yeah like I was just prepared for the first semester because and then uh yeah like first and courses are like something that everyone needs to have a look at before you get into University because like that's how you feel confident or under confident like if you are good with what you are going to take you'll feel lot better in upcoming semesters but if you feel low and then if you choose the wrong courses in the first semester you'll feel bad about United States or the college and then you'll feel that you might not be a good fit so make sure you do your research before choosing the courses in your first semester right and um and for the finance question you probably just said like I'm taking a loan is that Lo yeah yeah nice and then I you mentioned that I have a loan of 50 lakhs and then my personal expenses of 10 lakhs yeah got it okay um now comes you got golden words congratulations your Visa is approved uh what is the things you did right as soon as your Visa got approved and how much time did you have from the Visa getting approved till going to the UN was it like a month or so yeah I had around 45 days I got my Visa approved in November second week and then I flew in the last week of December so I had like 40 to 45 days in between so right after my Visa got approved the first thing I did was like the very next day I booked a flight ticket to United States to JFK and then next thing was like started shopping a lot like what to buy and then like what not to buy and then what to take what not to take and then like I started meeting my friends and amilies in different parts of India so I thought I meet them before I leave to United States so mostly it was like that like shopping and then yeah and then finding roommates and making connections or like finding rooms finding roommates and then all this stuff flight tickets and then uh who's going to pick me up once I land there nice so let's let's Deep dive just a little bit in it um how did you find roommates how did you find your apartment and then how did you figure out because I think lot of not a lot of people figure out like I landed and then who's going to take me from airport to the apartment un so or university yeah so how did you do these three things so coming to uh roommates thing so I started joining in lot of WhatsApp groups the links I found them on y app so like if you don't have the app installed there'll be lot of groups you can join them and then ask the students if you have any group for this University can you send it like most of the people will send it and you can join them finding roommates was not a problem and then finding room was the problem so what what but what was the process like did you just go online and started looking up or did you reach out to seniors to find the apartments like what was your process so as I mentioned I've joined the WhatsApp groups I had some help from the seniors like they were already there in the groups so they help some like they told me what places to look and what uh websites to look one of them was apartments. then the other was sua.com like both these are like pretty famous and they pretty like trustworthy I mean like websites are trustworthy but then the listings in the websites might not be so do your research right yeah yeah there are a lot of scams please please be be aware uh websites have legit uh listing but there are people who wants to scam you so once you find it make sure you reach out to your senior or your University ask them is this like really legit I really pay the down payment because I think the process at least in California this is the process like you would find a property then you like as soon as you like it you'll have to put down security deposit and that could be $1,000 to $1,500 and I mean in Connecticut might be more because the apart the rent was $4,000 so it's typically your whatever the rent is that's the deposit amount usually uh so so then you would have to put down so so if you don't know if the people who are putting it is legit or not you will lose that money so you don't want to right you don't want to lose that money so make sure you do your research before you pay the and when you reach out to them you can ask for a virtual tour so they will be more than happy to video call you or FaceTime or send a GM link which works for both of you you can schedule a like video call with them like don't be like don't like don't hesitate to ask for a video call because you're paying lacks of money and then like you're investing a lot so it's better not to get scammed yeah yeah 100% yeah my biggest advice is always reach out to your senior for making sure you're not going into a area which is like shady uh you like the it's not so far far away from your University uh and all of like and it is legit or not and then you obviously you ask all the questions to your apartment manager and like do the tours and all of that so cool okay so that's the process you found it uh you did me and meet your parents and family and uh you did the shopping you got ready for it uh obviously you in in your world you were already like preparing your profile for data analyst before because you took that gap of six months so so from career perspective you were also like kind of preparing in a way now comes the day of like you're flying and it's an exciting day so how was how was your feelings like like what were what were your thoughts at that point of time like to be honest I didn't want to B the slight at that moment like when I was at the airport like living I mean like I we were like 15 people like my dad's side of family mom side of family and then all of us were there like who were really close to me and then seeing all of them at once at one place I was like should I go and then I thought of the investment or the happiness that I've seen in everyone or like happiness that I had during the process and I had to take a deis so I was like I'll take the flight and then like I cried for two hours or 3 hours in the flight too but then yeah it's worth it now when I think about it I'm a totally different person right now like I was introvert now it's all different yeah like I feel a lot better right now like I learned how to be independent I was so dependent on my mom my dad it's all different so us will teach and and again like this is another thing uh I say to people it's not just about like career right like it's not just career growth you personally will grow like there's a lot of self-growth happens same with me I was an introvert kid I couldn't like speak in front of people uh but now I can and like I was also dependent on my parents and like luckily now I have Independence like I'm on my own feet and taking care of my bills and paying all this things so there's like lot more life skills you will learn other than your the hard skills which you obviously will learn through your career so exactly what was your will teach you a lot yes yes what was your Port of Entry interview was there anything uh for Yukon or like what was the interview like it was very simple like uh I have uh gone like I came out of the flight and then we were at the Port of Entry and then I gave a passport and all the and then he was like oh y gone all the best that's all nice okay yeah yeah Yukon obviously is very popular so that's probably what happened nice um cool so now what was your first week look like like what did you do what did you spend time on like yeah yeah for first two to three days uh they were like done in Zet lag so we couldn't wake up like we slept for almost 15 to 20 hours a day so we didn't know what the time was and then get used to it and then once we were in the track uh we took SIM cards and then bank accounts and then took pictures with the university and uh yeah these were the things or bank account and then get your cred card which doesn't require a SSN and then get a SIM card for sure and then if check if your mobile is working in the United States or if it's compatible or not so for the networks and then these are like four to five things that have done in the first two weeks and I get some groceries from India if possible yeah yeah yeah so you probably just yeah like getting settled basically is what uh you spend time on and then what about the cours workk like when did you had to register for the classes for your first semester did you do it before coming to India I mean to United States or did you do it after you landed I have done it after uh landed in after I landed in United States so I had some like like the deadline was not in December so my course work my course started on Jan 18 but then I was in United States on December 24th so I had like 25 days to settle down and then take courses so I thought I mean I had chance to take it take the courses back in India so I thought it's better to do in person with my friends or like like future friends so all of us were in United States and then we saw the curriculum once again and then we like topped out our opinions on each course Professor so we took some like five courses in the first semester um let's talk about like cour work because one of the beautiful part about studying in United States is you get to decide what your coursework looks like you get to design it you get to pick your courses you also sometimes if the university is too big you get to pick the professor you want to take for a specific course so how did you decide what courses you wanted to take obviously you knew in your back of your head that I want to become data analyst data engineer data scientist so what how did you decide like these are the courses I'm going to take and if you can even walk us through the curriculum like okay these are 37 credits I need to take here's how I broke it down yeah sure so first thing like for Yukon like you need to have some predict sites I mean like if you want to take Advanced courses you need to do some preds in your first semesters in order for them in order for you to be eligible to those Advanced courses so in the first semester I had two PRI predicts and then the other three were core so let me walk you through my curriculum so here it is okay this is the curriculum for Yukon like this is my this is the name of my degree Masters in Business analytics and project management and then my concentration was data science yeah so coming to the analytics these are the courses that have in analytics part and then these are the courses which comes under project management so So based on the course you could take so project management is a concentration is my guess yeah it's part of the uh like out of the 37 credits project management was around 12 credits the rest 25 uh was were related to analytics or data science or like they do have different concentrations that you can choose courses from it's combination of world and uh management World okay so so technically you could become a project manager if you wanted to um from your and you could also become technical project manager technical program manager from this coursework obviously it's heavy on analytics side so that that is all covered all right cool keep going and then these are the electives and you can also choose the concentrations concentration and then coming to concentrations there are like five concentrations that you can choose from I chose the business data science so for that you need to take three electives from this so I had taken introduction to deep learning data science using Python and then uh big data using Hardo so these are my three so I got this concentration so if you have something in mind like you're from marketing background or you're from actal background or if you want to get into these fields without having experience or something you can just give a try and then there's something called Healthcare analytics also which is very it's important in United like there are lot of opportunities in healthare yeah I mean you are working in one of the biggest healthcare insurance companies so yeah yeah uh interesting the tal Talent analytics is such an interesting uh topic like if someone wants to become like an HR or something yeah there are like six tracks that you can choose from and then there supply chain too so you need to choose three elos from these five these four courses to become to get this concentration so it's like there are different tracks that you can choose from this is one of the things uh that got me like you can you have the flexibility to become or choose whatever posts you want from different uh streams like or you if you don't want any concentration you can choose one from this one from this or two from this and one from that so if you want this title to be there on your degree you need to take three from this or two from this as they mentioned so if you do not want any concentration you are fine to take with you can choose you can mix and match okay nice okay cool uh and this tracks maybe these are the new ones oh there are certification programs that if you want to do yeah without the Masters program I guess yeah can you go back to the Core Curriculum okay and then scroll down so 13 courses you have to take uh right like you have 37 uh can you scroll just a little bit uh up Scroll up sorry uh yeah there you go so it says three semesters 13 courses you have to take so out of 13 courses which one did you took um what was your like exact 13 courses so in my first semester I had uh dbms which was SQL and then statistics using R and then I had PR modeling which was like machine learning and then I had this technical Communication business analytics and project management which is a one cred course and then the other one I chose from project management which is Introduction to project management so these were the five courses that I had in my first semester got it and then later on I started to choose electives right just to give breakdown for audience uh uh he took five courses which is a lot actually but two of them sounds like it was one credit course is that correct only this was one credit okay four were core like it was like 13 credits in first semester okay so three credits for each one of them so yeah that's why it's a 12 credit plus one credit course so total 13 credits okay got it and then obviously you took uh what was your second semester uh I did semester in summer also but it's not counted as a semester but then I had taken three courses in my summer and then three in my fall and then two in my spring again in the summer I had taken this recision modeling and then I took data science with python which was part of business data science concentration and then I had one more from this which was Project risk and agile methodologist three in summer go okay and again for people who don't know he didn't have on campus job for the first semester that's why he was able to take this many courses in the first semester just to you know give contact like people will go crazy do five courses and then also do 20 20 hours on campus job it's going to be too much to handle so just keep that in mind but yeah and S is like also Robo and machine so that's that's a different story but uh yeah this is awesome and obviously last semester you finished uh taking more from your data science I'm assuming yeah and in the last semester I had this Capstone project I took it in fault because I didn't want it I didn't want it to be in the last semester because I wanted uh that my last semester to be for job sear so I didn't want to stress myself so I took it in the fall semester the Capstone project and then I put the easiest ones for the last semester or else the ones I knew already so I wanted my last semer to be free and I didn't want much stress or much work to do as I wanted to focus on my job search and for people who don't know as well like summer you could do an internship you could do a semester like he did or you could go back to India I would never recommend you to go back to India I would use that time to actually do it but okay or not India but like any any country you're watching from all right let's talk about on campus job obviously you didn't have it in the first semester but then you did have teaching assistantship um what is teaching assistantship and how did you get it so for the first two semesters I didn't have a part time but in the third semester which is like second semester officially which is fall so I had two part times like one was tutoring like I was a math tutor uh I used to teach math to undergrads like in the like algebra statictics and everything the other was uh teaching assistant I mean the teaching assistant I got it in the last semester but then for the third semester uh I had math tutor which was like I had only for 10 hours a week so it wasn't stressful so in the third semester I had some course which is uh in the first semester I had one course which is SQL so the professor like I started like I used to answer questions when he has to like ask questions and answer the questions that he asked us so we had a good Rao and then in the third semester I took another course with the same Professor which is like data science with python he taught us very well all the machine learning Concepts and everything and I started uh talking with him like we became came so close and then I started answering like excelling the assignments and everything and at the end of the semester I put an like I sent an email saying that like Professor I would love to work with you I've learned a lot from you so then he was like would you be interested in becoming my ta so I was like okay I'm in for that so I became the TA for SQL uh in the final semester and then I had another part time which was like math Tut ring so I was doing two parts in my last semester and um for people who might have not watched the first uh video this is that's where he talked about why he decided to not do the part-time jobs or on campus jobs and he I mean invested that time on building his profile and preparing himself like you know doing the full-time job so go again check out that video if you haven't already uh cool so that that's awesome and then let's talk finally about like obviously we saw the coursework and it looks like there's so many roles you people could get depending on the courses they they could get into supply chain they could get into marketing analytics and marketing analyst business analyst data scientist data analyst project manager uh so which I mean you obviously chose the data analyst route what is the not a placement but like what is is the job market like look like do people who graduate from Yukon end up having a job I wouldn't generalize it to Yukon so like say you have graduated from Harvard and then if you can't do the work you're obvious you will not get job you'll not get a job obviously for sure like there's no doubt in that say you have graduated from normal university and then if you can do the work you'll get the job first like P 200k or 300K companies are ready to pay for you so it doesn't depend on the college that you have graduated from it depends on what you know and then what you don't know if you can do the work or if you can't do the work so uh like something this is something I wanted I I say to lot of people like never the college brand matters but then it matters only when you can do the work yeah yeah yeah I 100% agree even people who study in Chico State uh which is like very low rank University compared to like all the other universities they still have jobs from Tesla and Google and Microsoft uh so it's not the brand it's like what you do during your Masters and how you build your profile is what's going to get you the job so um final kind of questions is would you recommend people to go to Yukon if yes why and if no why not uh I would recommend people going to Yukon only if they they should be willing to do 37 credit course and then they should be fine with lot of expenses and then getting a parttime might be difficult in the first semester because it's a business school and then the main campus is like 200 miles from the business school so you would not have the campus life I had my I had a good campus life back back in Bachelor so I wasn't concerned about the campus life so if you're fine with all this you going a good choice like I would say no if you like the city might be expensive you will spend at least ,000 a month including your rent expenses and like New York is like 20 miles away away you would go there often so so considering these like part-time and then money things if you if you like if you think you want to spend less and then if you want to if you can't or there's some for some reason money is a problem or part time is important for you I wouldn't recommend and if if you like campus if you want campus life you wouldn't recommend like apart from these basic reasons coming to professional like career or uh opportunities it's very good University the professors are amazing I mean I can't thank enough like they have supported me a lot like I'm without I have transition from electrical to data science and then the help I received they even referred to me in their companies and then like one of the professors I got referred by her husband also in her husband's company so they're very helpful so like just make sure you have good connections with professors not just this University any University and then yeah like networking is very important yeah yeah again we've talked about how to get a job translation and all of that on that other video you should go check it out but again awesome um what's the one tip would you like if if you were to only give one advice to people who are planning to do their masters study abroad in United States um what is the one thing would you want them to know yeah like I wouldn't so one tip would be don't over steady don't over enjoy and then don't over spin like spin enjoy steady so make sure it's balanced you don't have to earn thousands of dollars when you're doing your Masters you can earn a lot more when you once you get a full time like it might take six months when you are doing your Masters but you can earn it in one month so don't overdo your parttime don't over enjoy don't over steady like do everything but then just make you're balancing it you'll meet a lot of amazing people us will teach a lot not it doesn't teach only the technical part of it but then you'll learn how to live how to live independently you'll find different people with different uh mindsets and then yeah you'll find good people bad people that's everywhere but yeah it will teach you a lot more than getting a job or like networking or enjoyment yes love it I love it all right um I can't wait to do this again because next time we're going to talk more deep depth of data analyst and road map to become a data analyst so subscribe if you haven't already um and again thank you Sai for such an like we went through the whole memory lane and exploring your Master's Journey so thank you again and until our next one keep smiling keep hustling nice\n"
